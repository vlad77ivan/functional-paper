Functional Paper is the name of the theme you are currently experiencing. It was built as an option for blogs using [Astro](https://astro.build) in the static site generator mode. For me Functional Paper means something simple that just gets things done.

The theme was built with the goals of being modern looking, light on dependencies and feature-rich. This is my first webdev project so it was also used as a learning opportunity. We will break down the features by category in the other posts.

By open sourcing the theme I hope it can be a good starting point for some amazing blogs. The source code is available at [functional-paper.git](https://github.com/vlad77ivan/functional-paper).
